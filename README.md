# [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Abstract

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The application allows the user to create a pattern of <br> their own or a randomly generated one. In addition, there's a pause feature that stops the game and allows <br>
the user to edit the board, and finally, a clear button in order to empty the grid.<br>
<br>
Requirements: [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

    ~/git clone https://github.com/BouzoulasDimitrios/Game-of-Life.git
    ~/cd Game-of-Life/
    ~/cd Game-of-Life/ ./launch.sh
